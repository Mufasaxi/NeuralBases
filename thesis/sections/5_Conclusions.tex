\label{sec:Conclusions}
We demonstrated that neural networks present a more than promising replacement to traditional chess endgame tablebases. This potential was highlighted with the use of a CNN architecture tailored for chess endgame position. The predictions are unfortunately not perfect like the tablebases, but nevertheless the use of only a fraction of the storage is a very important detail, given the margin of error for accuracy being overshadowed by the major drop in storage space requirements.

These results although imperfect provide a proof of a concept that could ignite a deeper search for the optimal neural network to replace tablebases completely. This comes with the challenge of creating a zero-knowledge based model like AlphaZero, and overcoming the main barrier of computational power and training time. For that one would need to dig deeper into the direction of reinforcement learning and more advanced deeper neural network architectures.

To close out this paper, traditional tablebases remain unmatched when it comes to their perfect accuracy, but the option of using and involving neural networks within that process is viable and shows promise in the long term. With the current advances in the field of machine learning, it is very plausible that the complete replacement of tablebase would be within reach.
