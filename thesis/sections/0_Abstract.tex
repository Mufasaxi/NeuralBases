Chess endgames, once solved by brute-force search through tablebases, present a unique opportunity for the application of neural networks. This thesis explores the potential of neural networks to surpass traditional tablebases in efficiency and capability for chess endgame resolution.

Moving beyond the limitations of tablebases, this work investigates the development of a neural network architecture specifically designed for chess endgame evaluation and optimal move selection. The thesis will delve into what a tablebase is and how it works, developing a neural network that provides the same functionality of a tablebase more effectively and comparing both approaches analytically in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability.

With that the aim would be to explore the boundaries of chess endgame evaluations and present the prospects of neural networks to replace traditional methodologies of chess programming.
